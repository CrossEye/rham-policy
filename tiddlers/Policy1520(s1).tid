title: Policy1520(s1)

The Board of Education recognizes that booster clubs, and other voluntary sports funding groups ("Booster
Clubs") organized for the benefit of athletic programs and other voluntary groups for the Region 8 Public
Schools are encouraged by the Region 8 Board of Education. The Board further recognizes the need to maintain
oversight of any and all athletic programs operated by and on behalf of the Board. The Board therefore
establishes the following guidelines with respect to the operation of any Booster club and/or athletic team which
is funded by such Booster club or other organization outside of the Region 8 Board of Education.
