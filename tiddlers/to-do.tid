title: to-do

!! From the recent refactoring
* ~~Figure out why print stylesheet is not working properly~~.  ''Fixed'':  was just missing a template
* ~~Remove remaining `Section####` tags, and fix print markup to no longer  use it.~~ ''Done''
* extract custom toc stuff into system tiddlers, and leave the main one with just a call using a filter.

!! General
* Remove markers in various outline styles if tiddler has section-type of history or legal. (perhaps if it has !!section-type at all.)  For example, [[Policy1410]].
* (Perhaps) remove all `created` and `modified` fields
